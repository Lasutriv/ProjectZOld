A procedurally generated platformer that is merely open world with dynamic building, fighting, and acrobatics.

To push Python as hard as possible in order to create a highly functioning game.
# What Is The Current Stage
Although the project has been worked on for countless hours, it's nowhere near completition but does allow for multiple scenes within multiple levels, this is if you have the full code. There are government tabs, inventory management, and a command console to allow custom item spawn for the character to perform pickup.

Reminder, this repository is only a fraction of the code.
